# Chess Game with some IAs
I retrieved a simple chess game in Python on internet, implementing chess rules. I added IAs (level easy : AI makes random moves, level medium : mixmax strategy with low depth, level hard : improvment of the mixmax strategy, called alphabeta), graphical features and tried to reorganise the code.

Dependencies :

pygame

pygame-menu

Just run the main.py file.

More IAs coming soon (machine learing) !
